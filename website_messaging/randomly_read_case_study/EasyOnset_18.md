Ah, there's the real culprit! You're running Node.js 10.15.3, which is ancient (from 2019) and incompatible with modern packages. Node 10 reached end-of-life in April 2021.

For your setup, I recommend Node.js 18 LTS - it's the sweet spot for stability and compatibility with your dependencies.

Upgrade Node.js
Option 1: Download from official site (recommended)

Go to https://nodejs.org
Download Node.js 18 LTS (Long Term Support)
Run the installer
Option 2: Use a Node version manager If you want to manage multiple Node versions:

# Install nvm-windows first from: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
nvm install 18.20.4
nvm use 18.20.4
After upgrading Node.js:
Verify the upgrade:
node --version
npm --version
Reinstall Yarn globally (since it was installed with the old Node):
npm install -g yarn
Try the install again:
cd client
yarn install
Why Node 18 LTS?
Compatible with all your MUI v5 dependencies
Stable - LTS means long-term support until April 2025
Modern features - Supports optional chaining, nullish coalescing, etc.
Good performance - Significant improvements over Node 10
Node 10 â†’ Node 18 is a big jump, but your codebase will thank you. The optional chaining error you saw earlier will disappear, and you'll get much better performance and security.

Let me know once you've upgraded Node and we can continue with the Yarn setup!
