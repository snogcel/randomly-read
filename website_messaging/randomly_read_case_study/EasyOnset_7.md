Great! The build is running again. We're making steady progress through the Material-UI v4 to MUI v5 migration.

Current Progress Summary
We've successfully fixed several files that were causing build errors:

✅ Fixed Files:

SyllableSelect.js - Converted makeStyles and withStyles to styled API
Administration/elements/UserSelect.js - Converted to MUI v5 styled components
ProgressIndicator.js - Converted class component with withStyles/withWidth to functional component with hooks
WordHistory/Vote/Component.js - Converted class component to functional component with useTheme hook
RoutineBuilder/elements/UserSelect.js - Converted makeStyles and withStyles to styled API
Migration Pattern Established
The systematic approach is working well:

For Components with makeStyles/withStyles:

Replace makeStyles → styled components
Replace withStyles → styled components
Update component usage to use styled components instead of classes
For Components with withWidth:

Replace withWidth HOC → useMediaQuery hook
Use useTheme to access theme breakpoints
For Class Components:

Convert to functional components when needed
Use useTheme hook instead of receiving classes via props
Replace lifecycle methods with useEffect hooks
The build-driven approach ensures we only fix files that are actually being used and imported, making this migration efficient and targeted. Each fix maintains the original functionality while updating to the modern MUI v5 patterns.
