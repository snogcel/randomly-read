Summary of the Systematic Approach We Used:
Identified the root cause: Missing imports for makeStyles and withStyles from @mui/styles

Fixed import patterns systematically:

Added { makeStyles, withStyles } imports where needed
Removed unused styled imports
Removed unused alpha imports
Fixed syntax errors:

Missing semicolons
Broken styled component definitions
Stray characters
Verified dependencies: Confirmed @mui/styles package is installed

This approach of fixing import issues in batches rather than one-by-one is much more efficient for Material UI v4 to v5 migrations. The key insight is that most files follow the same patterns, so once you identify the pattern, you can fix multiple files simultaneously.

Next steps if more errors appear:

Continue the same pattern for any remaining files
Eventually migrate from makeStyles/withStyles to the modern styled API
Update any theme.spacing() calls to the new syntax
The build should complete successfully now that we've addressed the major import and syntax issues!
