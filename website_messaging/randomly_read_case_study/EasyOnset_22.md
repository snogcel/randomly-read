RoutinePreview.js - Updated to use useQuery hook
WordCardContainer.js - Created functional wrapper component for useQuery
Updated all gql imports to use @apollo/client instead of graphql-tag
Maintained all existing GraphQL query logic and error handling
✅ Refactored word query components to use new Apollo Client hooks
WordCard Component: Completely refactored from class to functional component

Key Technical Improvements:
Modern Apollo Client 3.x Architecture: Using latest patterns with better performance and caching
