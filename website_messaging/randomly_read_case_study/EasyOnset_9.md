Excellent! The build is running again. This was a good example of converting multiple makeStyles calls to individual styled components.

Migration Patterns Refined
We now have five proven approaches for different component types:

1. Simple Components with makeStyles/withStyles:

Convert to styled components
Update component usage
2. Class Components with withStyles:

Convert to functional components with useTheme hook
Replace lifecycle methods with useEffect
3. Large/Complex Class Components:

Use wrapper component approach
Keep original class component intact
Provide theme and width via props
4. Functional Components with HOCs:

Replace withStyles → useTheme + styles(theme)
Replace withWidth → useMediaQuery hooks
Remove HOC wrapping from exports
5. Components with Multiple makeStyles:

Convert each makeStyles to individual styled components
Update component usage to use styled components directly
Remove useStyles calls
The systematic build-driven approach continues to be highly effective. We're making excellent progress through the comprehensive list of 60+ files that need migration, with each fix maintaining functionality while modernizing to MUI v5 patterns.

Let me wait to see if the build completes successfully or if there are more files that need attention.
