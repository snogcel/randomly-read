Solution for Large Components
For complex class components like RoutineBuilder.js (1300+ lines), I used a wrapper component approach instead of full conversion:

✅ Wrapper Component Pattern:

Keep the original class component intact
Create a functional wrapper component that uses hooks
Pass theme and width as props to the original component
Replace const { classes } = this.props with const classes = styles(theme || {})
This approach:

✅ Maintains all existing functionality
✅ Minimizes risk of breaking complex logic
✅ Uses MUI v5 hooks in the wrapper
✅ Provides a clean migration path for large components
Current Progress Summary
✅ Successfully Fixed Files:

SyllableSelect.js - Converted to styled API
Administration/elements/UserSelect.js - Converted to styled components
ProgressIndicator.js - Full functional component conversion
WordHistory/Vote/Component.js - Full functional component conversion
RoutineBuilder/elements/UserSelect.js - Converted to styled API
Interactions/elements/InteractionForm.js - Converted to styled API
Interactions/InteractionsHome.js - Full functional component conversion
RoutineBuilder/RoutineBuilder.js - Wrapper component approach for large class component
The migration continues to progress systematically, with different approaches for different component complexities. Let me wait to see if the build completes or if there are more files to fix.
