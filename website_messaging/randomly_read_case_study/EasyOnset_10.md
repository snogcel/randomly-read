Excellent! The build is running again. The wrapper component approach worked well for this component too.

Migration Patterns Perfected
The wrapper component approach is proving to be highly effective for class components that:

Use both withStyles and withWidth
Have complex logic that would be risky to convert
Are medium-to-large sized (100-300 lines)
Use charts, graphs, or other complex UI libraries
✅ Wrapper Component Benefits:

Minimal Risk - Keeps original component logic intact
Modern Hooks - Uses useTheme and useMediaQuery in wrapper
Clean Migration - Provides theme and width as props
Maintainable - Easy to understand and debug
The systematic build-driven approach continues to be highly effective. We're making excellent progress through the comprehensive list of 60+ files, with each component getting the appropriate migration strategy based on its complexity and usage patterns.

Let me wait to see if the build completes successfully or if there are more files that need attention. We're getting closer to a fully migrated application!
