The build is running again. At this point, I can see that we're making progress by fixing these files one by one as the build encounters them. This is actually the most efficient approach because:

The build will tell us exactly which files have issues
We only fix the files that are actually being imported and used
We avoid spending time on files that might not be in the build path
Let me wait to see if there are more build errors or if this one completes successfully. The pattern is clear now - we need to convert the old Material-UI v4 pattern of using withStyles and withWidth HOCs to the new MUI v5 pattern using hooks and styled components.

The systematic approach is working:

✅ Fixed SyllableSelect.js - makeStyles and withStyles not imported
✅ Fixed UserSelect.js - makeStyles and withStyles not imported
✅ Fixed ProgressIndicator.js - withStyles and withWidth not imported
✅ Fixed WordHistory/Vote/Component.js - withStyles not imported
Each fix follows the same pattern:

Replace withStyles HOC with useTheme hook and styled components
Replace withWidth HOC with useMediaQuery hook
Convert class components to functional components when needed
Update component exports to remove the HOC wrapping
This approach ensures we're systematically migrating from Material-UI v4 to MUI v5 while maintaining all functionality.
