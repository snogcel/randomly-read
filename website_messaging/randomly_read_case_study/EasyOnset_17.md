Perfect! Let's get Yarn set up and solve this Windows file locking nightmare once and for all.

npm install -g yarn
Step 2: Verify Yarn installation
yarn --version
Step 3: Clean up the existing npm mess
cd client
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
Step 4: Initialize Yarn and install dependencies

Benefits you'll get with Yarn:
Better Windows compatibility - No more EPERM errors
Faster installs - Parallel downloads and better caching
Deterministic builds - yarn.lock ensures everyone gets the same versions
Better error messages - Much clearer when things go wrong
Offline support - Can install previously downloaded packages without internet
Going forward, use these Yarn commands:
yarn or yarn install - Install dependencies
yarn add package-name - Add new dependency
yarn add -D package-name - Add dev dependency
yarn remove package-name - Remove dependency
yarn start - Start development server
yarn build - Build for production
Once you run yarn install, you should see it create a yarn.lock file. This replaces package-lock.json and should give you much more reliable dependency management on Windows.

Try running the install now and let me know how it goes!
