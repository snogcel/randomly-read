## Target Audience

### Primary Audience: Institutional Trading Firms & Hedge Funds

These organizations require robust, real-time, and highly accurate data analysis tools to execute quantitative trading strategies in the DeFi market.

- **Needs:** A platform that automates opportunity detection, provides reliable and accurate data feeds, integrates with existing quantitative models (like QLib), and demonstrates proven backtesting results.

### Secondary Audience: DeFi Protocol Development Teams

These teams build and maintain DeFi protocols and require deep market insights to optimize liquidity, enhance security, and ensure protocol stability.

- **Pain Points:** Difficulty in monitoring liquidity health, assessing risks like impermanent loss proactively, and understanding user behavior (e.g., whale activity) in real time.
- **Needs:** A comprehensive analytics tool that provides insights into liquidity stability, trader diversity, and arbitrage opportunities to improve capital efficiency and strengthen their protocol's market position.
