### Technical Stack Highlights

#### **Backend Architecture**
```python
# Async data collection with rate limiting
async def collect_with_rate_limits():
    async with RateLimiter(requests_per_second=2):
        data = await api_client.fetch_pools()
        await process_with_indicators(data)
```

#### **Machine Learning Integration**
```python
# QLib integration for quantitative analysis
def export_qlib_format(data):
    # OHLCV data with technical indicators
    # Feature engineering for ML models
    # Binary format export for QLib
```

#### **Infrastructure Resilience**
```python
# Circuit breaker with exponential backoff
@circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=3, recovery_timeout=60)
async def database_operation():
    # Self-healing database operations
    # Automatic retry with backoff
```
