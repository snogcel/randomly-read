Current Test Coverage Strengths üü¢
Client-side React components: Excellent coverage (85%)
Apollo Client 3.x integration: Complete migration testing
RandomlyRead therapy routes: All 9 routes tested across 3 levels
GraphQL queries: Comprehensive parameter testing
User interface workflows: End-to-end testing
Critical Coverage Gaps üî¥
Server-side code: 0% coverage (major risk)
GraphQL resolvers: Complex word generation logic untested
Database operations: MongoDB and MySQL integration untested
Authentication system: JWT and Passport.js untested
REST API endpoints: No API testing
Key Insights
Your test suite is heavily client-focused - which makes sense for a speech therapy application where user experience is critical. The tests cover:

All therapy levels (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
Complete user journeys through practice sessions
Accessibility compliance for therapeutic use
GraphQL word/sentence generation from the client perspective
However, the server-side gap is significant because your application has complex business logic for:

Phonetic word filtering and generation
Speech therapy routine management
User progress tracking
Multi-database operations (MongoDB + MySQL)
Recommendations
Immediate Priority: Add server-side testing for GraphQL resolvers - they contain critical speech therapy logic
High Priority: Test the authentication system and user management
Medium Priority: Add database integration tests for data integrity
Long-term: Implement performance testing for the word generation algorithms
The analysis shows you have a solid foundation for client-side quality assurance, but need to balance this with server-side testing to ensure the therapeutic algorithms and data management are reliable.
