I'll help you configure environment-based API routing. Let me first examine the current setup to understand how API requests are currently configured.

# Create Environment Variable Files

.env.development

.env.production

.env


# Update Test Files

- ApolloClient.test.js

- manualGraphQLTest.js

- GraphQLIntegration.test.js


# Update FluencyReportHistory Component

## note: interesting that only this component was updated

FluencyReportHistory.js

FluencyReportHistory.js

FluencyReportHistory.js

# Create a Configuration Helper (Optional)

api.js


# Update .gitignore to Include Environment Files


# Create Documentation

README-Environment.md


# Summary
I've configured environment-based API routing for your application. Here's what was set up:

âœ… Environment Files Created:
.env - Default fallback configuration
.env.development - Development configuration (localhost:4000)
.env.production - Production configuration (api.easyonset.com)
âœ… Updated Components:
Apollo Client in App/Component.js - Now uses REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT
API utilities in util/api.js - Now uses REACT_APP_API_URL
Test files - Updated to use environment variables
FluencyReportHistory - Updated all fetch calls to use environment variables
âœ… Configuration:
Package.json proxy - Updated to localhost for development
Configuration helper - Created src/config/api.js for centralized API config
Documentation - Created README-Environment.md with usage instructions
ðŸš€ How It Works:
Development Mode (npm start):

API calls go to http://localhost:4000
GraphQL endpoint: http://localhost:4000/graphql
Production Mode (npm run build):

API calls go to https://api.easyonset.com
GraphQL endpoint: https://api.easyonset.com/graphql

ðŸ”§ For Local Development:
If you want to override the development settings locally, create .env.development.local:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001/graphql

The application will now automatically route API requests based on the environment, with development pointing to localhost and production pointing to api.easyonset.com!
