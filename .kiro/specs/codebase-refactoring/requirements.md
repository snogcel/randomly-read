# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing RandomlyRead application, a sophisticated speech therapy platform focused on reading fluency and phonetic exercises. The application provides structured practice sessions with timer-based exercises, routine building capabilities, progress tracking, and multi-level training programs. The current codebase has several technical debt issues including outdated dependencies, complex component architecture, inconsistent state management patterns, and performance bottlenecks that need to be addressed through a comprehensive refactoring effort.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modernize Dependencies and Framework Versions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all outdated dependencies and frameworks so that the RandomlyRead application benefits from security patches, performance improvements, and modern development practices while maintaining the complex exercise timing and routine functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating client dependencies THEN the system SHALL upgrade React to version 18.x with proper migration of deprecated APIs while preserving timer functionality and exercise state management
2. WHEN updating Apollo Client THEN the system SHALL migrate from Apollo Client 2.x to Apollo Client 3.x with proper cache and link configuration for GraphQL word queries
3. WHEN updating Material-UI THEN the system SHALL migrate from Material-UI v4 to MUI v5 with updated theming and component APIs while maintaining the exercise interface design
4. WHEN updating server dependencies THEN the system SHALL upgrade to Apollo Server 4.x with proper GraphQL schema and resolver patterns for word database queries
5. WHEN updating Node.js dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure all packages are updated to their latest stable versions with security vulnerability fixes
6. WHEN updating React Router THEN the system SHALL migrate from React Router v5 to v6 with updated routing patterns for multi-level exercise navigation

### Requirement 2: Refactor Complex Component Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to simplify the complex component architecture and state management so that the exercise timing, routine building, and progress tracking features are more maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring exercise components THEN the system SHALL separate timer logic, routine management, and word display into distinct, reusable components
2. WHEN organizing state management THEN the system SHALL implement modern React patterns (hooks, context) to replace complex Redux patterns for exercise state
3. WHEN refactoring the RoutineBuilder THEN the system SHALL break down the 1300+ line component into smaller, focused components with clear responsibilities
4. WHEN implementing GraphQL queries THEN the system SHALL optimize word database queries and implement proper caching for exercise data
5. WHEN organizing component hierarchy THEN the system SHALL create a clear separation between exercise logic, UI components, and data management

### Requirement 3: Implement TypeScript for Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript implementation across the entire codebase so that type-related bugs are caught at compile time and code maintainability is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting client code THEN the system SHALL implement TypeScript with strict type checking enabled
2. WHEN converting server code THEN the system SHALL implement TypeScript with proper type definitions for all models and APIs
3. WHEN defining GraphQL types THEN the system SHALL generate TypeScript types from GraphQL schema automatically
4. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
5. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL define proper type interfaces for all data structures

### Requirement 4: Improve Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication and authorization so that my data is protected and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing JWT authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure token storage with proper expiration handling
2. WHEN validating user input THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
3. WHEN handling passwords THEN the system SHALL use proper bcrypt hashing with appropriate salt rounds
4. WHEN implementing authorization THEN the system SHALL use role-based access control with proper middleware
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL implement proper environment variable management for secrets

### Requirement 5: Optimize Exercise Performance and Timing Accuracy

**User Story:** As a speech therapy user, I want precise exercise timing and smooth transitions between words so that my practice sessions are effective and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running timed exercises THEN the system SHALL implement high-precision timing mechanisms that maintain accuracy during word transitions
2. WHEN loading exercise data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching strategies for word databases and routine configurations
3. WHEN switching between exercise levels THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for different training modules (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
4. WHEN displaying word cards THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering performance to prevent timing disruptions during exercise sessions
5. WHEN managing large routine datasets THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures and algorithms for routine building and execution

### Requirement 6: Enhance Testing Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage so that refactoring can be done safely without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL implement unit tests using React Testing Library with proper accessibility testing
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL implement integration tests with proper database mocking
3. WHEN testing GraphQL resolvers THEN the system SHALL implement resolver-level tests with proper context mocking
4. WHEN testing user flows THEN the system SHALL implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% code coverage across all modules

### Requirement 7: Improve Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in components THEN the system SHALL implement error boundaries with proper fallback UI
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement consistent error handling with user-friendly messages
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement structured logging with proper error categorization
4. WHEN handling GraphQL errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper error formatting and client-side error handling
5. WHEN monitoring the application THEN the system SHALL implement proper health checks and monitoring endpoints

### Requirement 8: Optimize Word Database and Exercise Data Management

**User Story:** As a speech therapist, I want efficient word database queries and reliable exercise data storage so that routine building and progress tracking work seamlessly with the 155,000+ word database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying the word database THEN the system SHALL implement optimized GraphQL resolvers with proper indexing for phonetic searches (consonants, vowels, syllables, positions)
2. WHEN storing exercise progress THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures for tracking word history, fluency reports, and routine completion
3. WHEN managing routine configurations THEN the system SHALL optimize storage and retrieval of complex routine definitions with multiple exercise steps
4. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL implement proper data relationships between therapists, clients, routines, and progress tracking
5. WHEN performing phonetic filtering THEN the system SHALL optimize blacklist algorithms and consonant/vowel filtering for real-time exercise generation
