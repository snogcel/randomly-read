```

### Key Components

#### 1. Models (TypeScript + Mongoose)
- **User**: Enhanced user model with proper validation and methods
- **Routine**: Complex routine configuration with phonetic settings
- **Word**: Optimized word model with voting and view tracking
- **Progress**: Exercise session and progress tracking models
- **FluencyReport**: Automated fluency report generation

#### 2. Services Layer
- **WordService**: 
  - Optimized phonetic queries with MongoDB aggregation
  - Intelligent word caching and prefetching
  - Blacklist filtering and consonant/vowel validation
- **RoutineService**: 
  - Routine validation and step configuration
  - User assignment and access control
  - Routine sharing between therapists and clients
- **ProgressService**: 
  - Real-time exercise session tracking
  - Progress record aggregation
  - Automated fluency report generation
- **UserService**: 
  - JWT authentication and token management
  - User role management (admin, superuser, therapist, client)
  - Password security with bcrypt

#### 3. GraphQL API
- **Schema**: Comprehensive GraphQL schema with proper type definitions
- **Resolvers**: Type-safe resolvers with authentication and authorization
- **Context**: Secure context creation with user authentication
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with proper logging

#### 4. REST API
- **Authentication**: Login, register, password change endpoints
- **User Management**: Profile management and user administration
- **Health Checks**: System monitoring and status endpoints

#### 5. Middleware
- **Authentication**: JWT token verification and user context
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and structured responses
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations
- **Compound Indexes**: Optimized indexes for phonetic queries (consonant + vowel + position)
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Efficient word filtering with MongoDB aggregation
- **Query Optimization**: Reduced query complexity and improved response times

### Caching Strategy
- **Word Caching**: Intelligent caching for frequently accessed words
- **Session Caching**: Exercise session state management
- **Query Result Caching**: Cached results for common phonetic combinations

### Memory Management
- **Singleton Services**: Efficient memory usage with service singletons
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized MongoDB connection management
- **Garbage Collection**: Proper cleanup of exercise timers and resources

## Security Improvements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Security**: Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with configurable salt rounds
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper authorization for admin, superuser, and client roles
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with express-validator

### Data Protection
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Mongoose ODM protection
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting for API endpoints

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/randomly_read

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Server
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=production

# Word Database
MAX_WORD_QUERY_LIMIT=1000
DEFAULT_WORD_LIMIT=1
WORD_CACHE_ENABLED=true
WORD_CACHE_TTL=1800

# Security

```

## Migration Guide

### From Legacy Server
1. **Install Dependencies**: Use the new `package.json.refactored`
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure environment variables
3. **Database Migration**: Existing MongoDB data is compatible
4. **API Changes**: GraphQL endpoints remain compatible, REST endpoints updated
5. **Authentication**: JWT tokens remain compatible

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run database seeding
npm run seed
```
