Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive refactoring spec for your RandomlyRead application. The spec includes:

What We've Accomplished
Requirements Document - Focused on the actual application patterns:

Modernizing dependencies while preserving complex exercise timing
Refactoring the massive component architecture (like the 1300+ line RoutineBuilder)
Optimizing exercise performance and timing accuracy
Improving the word database and phonetic filtering systems
Design Document - Comprehensive architecture plan:

Modern layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
Detailed component interfaces for exercise system, routine builder, and progress tracking
Performance optimizations for real-time exercise timing
Database optimizations for the 155,000+ word database with phonetic searches
Implementation Plan - 47 actionable coding tasks:

Incremental approach starting with TypeScript setup and dependency updates
Breaking down complex components into manageable pieces
Optimizing the critical exercise timing and word query systems
Comprehensive testing and performance validation
Key Highlights
The refactoring plan addresses the real complexity of your application:

Exercise Timing System: High-precision timers for speech therapy exercises
Routine Builder: Breaking down the massive component into focused, maintainable pieces
Word Database: Optimizing GraphQL queries for phonetic filtering across 155k+ words
Progress Tracking: Efficient data structures for fluency reports and exercise history
Next Steps
You can now begin executing tasks by opening the tasks.md file and clicking "Start task" next to any task item. I recommend starting with Task 1 (TypeScript setup) as it provides the foundation for all subsequent refactoring work.

The plan is designed to be executed incrementally, so you can tackle one task at a time while maintaining a working application throughout the refactoring process.
